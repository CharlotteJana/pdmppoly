Title: Moment Approximation for Polynomial PDMPs
Version: 0.0-1
Author: Charlotte Jana
Maintainer: Charlotte Jana <charlotte.jana@t-online.de>
Description: Calculate the moments of piecewise deterministic markov processes 
    that fulfill additional constraints. To be precise, these processes need to 
    have polynomial rates and polynomial dynamics. Moment calculation is done
    via a ode system arising by the generator, which can be calculated, too.
    If the ode system is not closed, it is modified leading to approximated
    results for the moments.
