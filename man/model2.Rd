\title{Gene regulation with constant activation and translation}
\format{\code{genePdmp2} is an object of class \code{\link[pdmpsim]{pdmpModel}}, \cr 
  \code{genePoly2} is an object of class \code{\link{polyPdmpModel}}.}
\source{
The model, including most of the parameter sets, are described in
  [RajCo2006] and [Zeiser2009]. The parameter values do not rely on real data.

\usage{
genePdmp2

genePoly2
}
\description{
This PDMP models the most simple situation of gene regulation,
where we have one gene and a constant activation rate without
a further regulation mechanism. Transcription and translation
are modeled separately which leads to a model wit two continous
variables (the first (\code{ξ1}) representing the mRNA and the
second (\code{ξ2}) representing the protein arising from translation).
In PROM, this model is referred to as \emph{Model 2},
therefore it is named \code{genePdmp2} and \code{genePoly2} here.

\section{Simulation}{

The simulations in PROM were done with slot \code{times} set to
\itemize{
\item \code{from = 0, to = 1000, by = 0.1.}
}
The following parameter sets were simulated:
\itemize{
\item \code{κ01 = 0.01, κ10 = 0.01, α1 = 1, β1 = 0.06, α2 = 0.5, β2 = 0.02}
\item \code{κ01 = 0.01, κ10 = 0.01, α1 = 1, β1 = 0.025, α2 = 0.5, β2 = 0.02}
\item \code{κ01 = 0.01, κ10 = 0.03, α1 = 1, β1 = 0.025, α2 = 0.5, β2 = 0.0025}
}
