#' Class polyPdmpModel
#' 
#' An S4 class to represent polynomial piecewisc deterministic markov processes
#' (polynomial PDMPs). These processes are PDMPs with polynomial rate functions
#' and polynomial dynamics. This makes it possible to approximate the moments of
#' the process without the need of simulation, see \code{\link{momApp}}. On the
#' downside, simulations take much longer than simulations of the same PDMP 
#' represented as \code{pdmpModel}. \cr  
#' The class is based on the \code{\link[pdmpsim]{pdmpModel}} class of package
#' \pkg{pdmpsim} but introduces additional slots that replace the slots
#' \code{dynfunc} and \code{ratefunc}, namely \code{dynpolys}, \code{dynsprays},
#' \code{ratepolys} and \code{ratesprays}. Only slots \code{dynpolys} and
#' \code{ratepolys} have to be defined by the user. The other slots (including
#' the still existing \code{dynfunc} and \code{ratefunc}) will be set
#' automatically. To represent polynomials in \code{R}, package \pkg{spray} is
#' used, which stores the coefficient matrices of polynomials as sparse arrays.
#' 
#' @slot dynpolys an object of class \code{language}, more precisely a quoted
#'   list. Every element of this list contains the ODE for one of the continous
#'   variables. These ODEs are given as \code{spray} objects and can be defined
#'   in two different ways. See section dynpolys for further information.
#' @slot ratepolys an object of class \code{language}, more precisely a quoted
#'   list.This list contains the rates for every jumptype. Every element is
#'   itself a list, its length is determined by the number of different values
#'   of the discrete variable (\code{length(discStates(obj)[[1]])}). See section
#'   ratepolys for further information.
#' @slot dynsprays a nested list of spray objects. This slot is generated
#'   automatically out of slot \code{dynpolys}. Do not edit it by hand.
#' @slot ratesprays a nested list of spray objects. This slot is generated
#'   automatically out of slot \code{ratepolys}. Do not edit it by hand.
#' @note Currently, all methods only work for PDMPs with a single discrete
#'   variable, but it is always possible to redefine a PDMP with multiple
#'   discrete variables in a way that only one discrete variable is necessary.
#' 
#' @section Ratepolys:
#' Slot ratepolys is a quted list. The length of the list determines the number
#' of existing jumptypes (jumptypes are used in slot \code{jumpfunc} to
#' determine the next state the process jumps too). It contains the rates
#' determining the probability of a jump to be of type 1, 2, and so on. The
#' rates are polynomials that usually depend on the value of the discrete
#' variable at the time when the jump occurs. They are given as a list of spray
#' objects or numbers, for every possible discrete state separately (in the same
#' order as the states are given in slot \code{discStates}). \cr
#' 
#' For example, let's assume that we have three different jumptypes and a
#' discrete variable \code{d} that can take the values 0 or 1 (so slot
#' \code{discStates} would be defined as \code{list(d = 0:1)}). Then slot
#' \code{ratepolys} will be given as follows:
#' \preformatted{quote(list(
#'   list(rate of jtype 1 with d = 0, rate of jtype 1 with d = 1),
#'   list(rate of jtype 2 with d = 0, rate of jtype 2 with d = 1),
#'   list(rate of jtype 3 with d = 0, rate of jtype 3 with d = 1),
#' ))}
#' Every \code{rate of jtype i with d = j} is a spray object, for example 
#' \code{linear(1:3)}.
#' 
#' @section Dynpolys:
#' Slot dynpolys is a quoted list. The length of the list equals the number of
#' continuous variables of the model. Every element contains the ODE for one of
#' the continuous variables, given in the same order as in slot \code{init} and
#' given as spray objects. \cr The ODEs usually depend on the discrete variable,
#' lets call it \code{d}. An example would be \eqn{\frac{df}{dt} = -3f}{df/dt =
#' -3f} if \eqn{d = 0} and  \eqn{\frac{df}{dt} = -3f + 1}{df/dt = -3f + 1} if
#' \eqn{d = 1}. Here, \code{f} is the only continous variable of the model.
#' Every ODE can be defined in two different ways:
#' 
#' \itemize{
#' \item variant 1: \cr
#' a list whose length equals the number of different states for d. Every entry is a 
#' polynomial with d taking a fixed value. The order of the entries corresponds
#' to the order of discrete states given in slot \code{discStates}.
#' \item variant 2: \cr
#' a list of two variables:
#' \itemize{
#' \item a variable \code{overall} which contains a polynomial that is independent 
#' of fixed values for \code{d} and is therefore the same for all states 
#' (attention: \code{overall} can contain \code{d} as a formal variable),
#' \item a variable \code{specific} which contains the rest of the term.
#' This is a list of the same form as in variant 1.
#' }}
#' In our example, we get
#' \itemize{
#' \item Variant 1: \cr
#' \code{quote(list(list(-3*lone(1,2), -3*lone(1,2) + 1)))}
#' \item Variant 2: \cr
#' \code{quote(list(list(overall = linear(c(-3, 0)), specific = list(0, 1))))}
#' \item Variant 2 with one formula: \cr
#' \code{quote(list(list(overall = linear(c(-3, 1))))}
#' }
#' 
#' The last variant is only possible, because in this example we have the
#' possiblity to write both ODEs in one formula: \eqn{\frac{df}{dt} = -3f +
#' d}{df/dt = -3f + d}.
